# all of the changes for the sb3 library are in the file offPolicyRecord.txt under UTMIST-AI2 (main folder). Just copy and paste the whole file
# into off_policy_algorithm.py which is in Lib->Site-Packages-> stable_baselines3 ->common->off_policy_algorithm.py





Fancy mods are done to the libraries, and are not captured by github
Fancy Modification 1: All the changes are in off_policy_algorithm.py
- VEC MARK 1 : Saves the model every x episodes. 
    - in learn()
    - Go here to change the number of episodes before saving.
- VEC MARK 2 : Modifies the action selection thing. Note that this only applies during learning, not during prediction, so it doesn't mess with pvp_match
    - in collect_rollouts()
    - Likely needs to be changed if obs space changes
- VEC MARK 3 - On done (episode reset), change that env's opponent.
    - at end of collect_rollouts()
    - Go here to change likelihood of facing constant agent.











Removals:
- Removed basically everything involving the adjusted observation space (the class definitino, and its use in SubmittedAgent)
- use search for the word "VECREMOVAL"
- Check if VEC MARK 2 needs to be modified













Other notes:
Std Modification 1: PickleableSurface in environment.py
- self.canvas, backgroundimage in Camera
- spear/hammer img in _setup of warehousebrawl
- pygameframe in AnimationSprite2D

Std Modification 2: SubProcVecEnv:
- Imports added as needed
- train() takes lambda constructors instead of objects
- Modified train() in agent.py and main() in train_agent.py heavily
- Moved custom wrapper classes over to agent.py
- Heavily modified selfPlayWarehouse
    - Kind of just went throught and struck out every function

Std Modification 3: my_agent.py is modified to work with saving.
- added SubmittedAgent.updateOpponentList
- added SubmittedAgent.vecBeforeLearning
- changed imports slightly

Std Modification 4: Misc
- Agent class has act_helper and obs_helper commented out
- Actionwrapper has to handle the fact inputs are now a dict of two Discrete(42), instead of one.
